----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper takes some first steps towards a form of logic motivated by a vision of cohesive homotopy type theory. Homotopy type theory is very trendy, though much still needs to be done to understand that project. The brief explanation of the intention of the cohesive version is prima facie compelling but it is very unclear what this will look like. In any case - as explained at the end of the Introduction - the paper relies on lots of restrictions. These make what is very unfamiliar material just about accessible.
The paper is very much a sketch of both the category theory and the proof theory. It could be the
basis for an interesting conference presentation but some thought needs to go into what to highlight. Just running through would be very boring. On the category side one might focus on the point that the
setting allows to represent an adjoint triple. On the proof theory one could maybe formulate precisely and answer the question whether the two rules are invertible. Less is more in cases like this.

Presentation issues.
1. The subsentence at the top of page 4 beginning 
$F_{\alpha}$ preserves colimits 
does not appear to be English and is certainly not clear. And a couple of lines further down the closing bracket should come after the word additionally not before.
2. Page 5. What are atomic propositions - written $P$ half way down? Not clear.
3. There seems to be confusion about cut. In Fig 1 we are referred to the extended
version for inter alia the cut rule. But we don't say anything explicitly about cut elimination and later just say cut is an admissible rule. Also at end of 2.1 (in a paragraph which is very hard to
understand if you cannot already guess what is going on) there is an odd reference to the value
of using a cut-free sequent calculus. It gives the impression of muddle.
4. Issues about equations between derivations are pretty opaque in this presentation. In the longer run something more precise will be needed - certainly for dependent types (cf Streicher's old thesis).
5. The bibilography has lots of failures of capitals and circle is not correct in a paper of the authors!

Summary:

Following work of Reed (2009), where one generates a logic from an assignment of categories and adjunctions to elements and inequalities in a preorder, the authors describe a logic parameterized by a 2-category M of modes.  The intended semantics is as a pseudofunctor M -> Adj where Adj is the 2-category of categories, adjunctions and conjugate natural transformations.  The interest in this adjoint logic stems from its origins in the earlier work of Reed, Benton and Wadler (1996), and others, and considerations from homotopy type theory.  The logic is restricted in three significant ways: only single hypotheses and conclusions of sequents, simple and not dependent types, and a 1-categorical semantics.  The paper itself consists of an introduction describing the motivation, a description of the sequent calculus itself, a brief description of the semantics, examples, and a conclusion.


Opinion:

Although the introduction promises many interesting connections, the paper itself is concerned with formal matters that are unsurprising given the description of the sequent calculus.  The sequent calculus itself constitutes a modest generalization of the earlier work mentioned above.  Sadly, the interesting connections are deferred to future papers, which came as a bit of a disappointment after reading the first few pages of the paper.  That said, the calculus presented here is something that had to be done and I expect this paper to be a useful reference in connection with the promised future work.  I believe the results of the paper to be correct, especially in light of having been proof-checked in Agda. Therefore, I recommend that the paper be accepted.  The typos and other minor changes described below should also be addressed at the discretion of the authors.


Typos/changes:

page 1 line 6: "a a map" -> "a map"

page 2 line 11: "points a" -> "points of a"

page 5: There is a mixing of syntax and semantics in the discussion here that makes understanding the connection between the mode 2-category and the syntax of the sequent calculus more difficult than it should be.  You should mention that you denote by p both the object of the mode 2-category and the category which is the image of p under the pseudofunctor.  Also the pseudofunctor seems to appear here more by means of explaining the intended semantics and this fact should be explicitly stated somewhere so that the precise assumptions needed to describe the syntax are clear to the reader.

page 9 line 4: "left commutative" -> "left-commutative"

page 10: As you know, being able to construct a pseudofunctor out of the syntax on its own does not guarantee a completeness result. The constructed pseudofunctor P should have the property that validity in P ensures derivability in the calculus, which need not be true.  Therefore, I suggest either changing the statement of Theorem 1 to reflect this fact or else to label Theorem 1 as "Soundness" and Theorem 2 as “Completeness” (where it is essentially clear that the pseudofunctor has the property described above).

page 15: Names appearing in the titles of papers (4, 10) should be capitalized. For ref 11, "cirlce" -> "circle".

----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper presents type theory intended to isolate the logical
foundations of a type system where types may live in diferent semantic
categories, yet remain connected by a collection of adjunctions,
parameterized in this paper by what the authors refer to as a
$2$-category of \emph{modes}.  The setup is general enough to account
for situations where multiple, possibly related adjunctions enter the
picture, and is aimed at the primary example of \emph{cohesive homotopy
type theory}.

While the underlying semantic notions are elementary from the point of
view of category theory (indeed, the type theory is clearly aimed to
capture just these basic notions), the system presented here is
nonetheless rather clever, and results in a pleasing proof theory.

The goal of unifying topological and homotopy-theoretic notions inside
(some generalization of) homotopy type theory is both natural and
important, and this paper provides a nice first step at sketching what
kind of logic might support such a unification.

I recommend that the paper be accepted.

Review: Adjoint Logic with a 2-Category of Modes
(Daniel R. Licata and Michael Shulman)


Summary:
-------

This paper explores a common generalization of the concepts of adjoint modality from proof theory and of axiomatic cohesion from synthetic topology.  Specifically, it generalizes the idea of a preorder of modes to a category, allowing for the possibility of multiple adjunctions between the same pair of categories.  The mode category is then endowed with 2-dimensional structure, allowing it to encode constructions such as adjoint triples, or even adjoint quadruples, which occur in axiomatic cohesion.

The authors introduce a sequent calculus style proof theory for this system, demonstrate some of its proof-theoretic properties such as cut admissibility, describe its equational theory of proofs and show soundness and completeness with respect to the categorical semantics.  They then use this system to represent some mode specifications involving adjoint triples.


Analysis:
--------

This paper is full of interesting ideas about categorical semantics and proof theory, indeed, perhaps too many to fit within the page limit.  I often got the feeling that the authors were struggling to decide what to include and what to defer to the referenced online extended version.

I found the introduction section to be very good in terms of providing background and motivation.  One possible way to buy a bit of space might be to curtail the discussion of cohesive homotopy type theory, since that is already the subject of related work and the present paper considers only 1-categorical semantics of derivations and adjoint triples (rather than ∞-groupoid semantics and adjoint quadruples).

The aspect of the paper that I struggled with most was trying to understand the idea behind the "heterochiral" adjoint logic rules (FR and UL); for example, why they (and only they) "baked in" movement along a 2-cell.  Additional exposition on this topic would have been helpful.

The section on semantics and the examples involving the "walking adjunction" and "walking reflection" were very clear, interesting and enjoyable.

I felt reassured that the properties of the derivation system that I couldn't (or didn't take the time to) understand had been formalized in a proof assistant so that I, as a human, could focus on the conceptual aspects of the paper.  This is as it should be.

Overall, this is a good paper that could benefit from an improved explanation of how the proposed proof theory arises from the intended semantics and tighter editing that is more focused on the main included results.  I recommend acceptance.


Specific Remarks and Questions:
-------------------------------

* (p.2-) Could you please provide, or cite, a proof that an adjunction in the mode 2-category determines an adjoint triple?  This result becomes important later in your paper and readers who don't yet know it and are too lazy or dumb to work it out for themselves might really appreciate it (asking for a friend ;-).  I realize that you give a partial internal proof in your derivation system in Lemma 2, but that and the cited Agda code don't really help me understand the underlying idea.

* (p.3) You might consider citing David Ellerman and his "heteromorphisms" when discussing the semantics for your "mixed-category" entailment judgements.

* (p.4) Typo, or at least infelicitous phrasing: "Γ preserves both colimits and limits, because it is an equivalent U_∆ and F_∇".

* (p.4)  The concept of conjugate pairs of natural transformations as parallel adjunction morphisms is obscure enough to be worth explaining.  I had to go and look it up in Mac Lane before I could understand what the 2-category Adj was supposed to be.

* (p.4) Typo: "In Section 3, [we] discuss...".

* (p.5-6) I spent a looong time staring at the inference rules (particularly FR and UL) and trying to understand what they could mean.  Even with the exposition immediately following their introduction, I couldn't really understand them until I had read much further into the paper.  This makes me think that you might consider delaying their introduction until after you have discussed the semantic side of the system a bit more.  You should at least provide a diagram to help the reader understand the situation you describe in the exposition for the rule FR.

* (p.6) Typo: "The case for UR is dual" (should be UL).

* (p.6) I failed to understand the significance of the statement, "note that because M is a strict 2-category, the identity 2-cell has type 1_q ∘ α ⇒ α ∘ 1_p".

* (p.6) Typo: "○_α := F_α (U_α A)".  Missing "A", and more importantly, you said that the ○-modality forms a monad, so I suppose that should be, "○_α (A) := U_α (F_α A)".

* (p.10) Typo: "...morphisms are morphisms are derivations..."

* (p.11) The fact that the interpretation of 2-cells in the mode category is contravariant was not obvious to me and caused me much confusion.  You might want to point this out earlier.

* (p.11) Typo(?): "composition in diagrammatic notation".  "Order", maybe?

* (p.12) In "Since a right or left adjoint of a given functor is unique up to isomorphism, it follows that the two functors U_d , F_n : c → s are equal...", are you using "equal" in the HoTT sense?

* (p.13) In the section on reflection, it might be helpful to remind the reader that a full and faithful (right/left) adjoint is equivalent to the adjunction (counit/unit) being an isomorphism.

\section{Introduction}

An adjunction $F \la U$ between categories \C and \D\/ consists of a
pair of functors $F : \C \to \D$ and $U : \D \to \C$ such that maps
\arrow{\D}{F C}{D} correspond naturally to maps \arrow{\C}{C}{U D}.  A
prototypical adjunction, which provides a mnemonic for the notation, is
where $U$ takes the underlying set of some algebraic structure such as a
group, and $F$ is the free structure on a set---the adjunction property
says that a structure-preserving map from $F C$ to $D$ corresponds to a
a map of sets from $C$ to $U D$, because the extension to the structure
is determined by the requirement of being a homomorphism.  Adjunctions
are important to the $\lambda$-calculi and proof theories of modal
logics, because the composite $FU$ is a comonad, while $UF$ is a monad.
\citet{bentonwadler96adjoint} describe an adjoint $\lambda$-calculus for
mixing linear logic and structural/cartesian logic, with functors $U$
from linear to cartesian and $F$ from cartesian to linear, where the $!
A$ modality of linear logic arises as the comonad $FU$.
\citet{reed09adjoint} describes a generalization of this idea to
situations involving more than one category: the logic is parametrized
by a preorder of \emph{modes}, where every mode $p$ determines a
category, and there is an adjunction between categories $p$ and $q$
exactly when $p \ge q$.  For example, the intuitionistic modal logics of
\citet{pfenningdavies} can be encoded as follows: the $\Box$
necessitation modality is the comonad $FU$ for an adjunction between
``truth'' and ``validity'' categories, the $\bigcirc$ modality is the
monad $UF$ of an adjunction between ``truth'' and ``lax truth''
categories, while the $\diamond$ possibility modality requires a more
complicated encoding involving four adjunctions between four categories.
While concrete adjunctions such as $(A \times -) \la (A \to -)$ also
arise, these calculi provide an internal language for uninterpreted
adjunctions.

In Reed's logic, modes are specified by a preorder, which allows at most
one adjunction between any two categories (more precisely, there can be
two isomorphic adjunctions if both $p \ge q$ and $q \ge p$).  However,
it is sometimes useful to consider multiple different adjunctions
between the same two categories.  A motivating example is Lawvere's
\emph{axiomatic cohesion}~\citep{lawvereXXcohesion}.  In this case, we
have two categories \C and $\mathcal{S}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ plays the
role of sets, and \C is sets equipped with some \emph{cohesive
  structure}, where elements can be ``stuck together'' in some way.  A
variety of notions of cohesion---topological, differentiable, smooth,
\ldots---can be described abstractly by a quadruple of adjoint functors
$\Pi_0 \la \Delta \la \Gamma \la \nabla$, where $\Gamma,\Pi_0 :
\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{S}$ and $\Delta,\nabla : \mathcal{S} \to
\mathcal{C}$.  $\Gamma$ takes the underlying set of a space, forgetting
the cohesive structure.  Its left adjoint $\Delta$ equips a set with
\emph{discrete cohesion}, where no points are stuck together; the
adjunction says that a map \emph{from} a discrete space is the same as a
map of sets.  Its right adjoint $\nabla$ equips a set with codiscrete
cohesion, where all points are stuck together; the adjunction says that
a map \emph{into} a codiscrete space is the same as a map of sets.  The
left adjoint of $\Delta$, $\Pi_0$ gives the set of connected
components---i.e. the sets of points that are stuck together; the
adjunction says that a map from the set of connected components is the
same as a map into a discrete space.  These functors must satisfy some
additional laws, such as $\Delta$ and $\nabla$ being fully
faithful---maps between discrete or codiscrete spaces should be the same
as maps of sets.

A variation of Lawvere's notion of axiomatic cohesion is currently being
explored in the setting of homotopy type theory and univalent
foundations~\citep{voevodsky06note,uf13hott-book}.  Homotopy type theory
uses Martin-L\"of's intensional type theory as a logic of homotopy
theory, where the identity type of type theory provides an
$\infty$-groupoid structure on each type.  Theorems from homotopy theory
can be proved \emph{synthetically} in this
logic~\citep{ls13pi1s1,lb13pinsn,...}, and interpreted in a variety of
models~\citep{...}.  The identity type equips every type with an
\emph{algebraic} $\infty$-groupoid structure, providing primitive
notions of morphism between elements of types, morphisms between those
morphisms, and so on.  While we often refer to these morphisms as
``paths,'' an important but subtle distinction is that these paths have
a priori nothing to do with the topological structure on
types~\citep{scott,etc}, which provides a different notion of a
``path,'' e.g. as a map from the real interval.  For example, in
homotopy type theory as in \citep{uf13hott-book}, there is no way to
connect the algebraic definition of the circle as a higher inductive
type to the topological definition of the circle as $\{ (x,y) \in
\mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\}$, and therefore no way to apply the
body of results in synthetic homotopy theory to traditional topological
spaces.  \emph{Cohesive homotopy type theory}~\citep{ss12,shulman15}
addresses this issue by integrating axiomatic cohesion into homotopy
type theory, using an adjoint quadruple $\sh \la \Delta \la \Gamma \la
\nabla$.  In this higher categorical generalization, $\mathcal{S}$ is
some category like $\infty$-groupoids---where the ``standard'' model of
homotopy type theory lives---and $\C$ should be thought of as cohesive
$\infty$-groupoids---i.e. $\infty$-groupoids that additionally have some
cohesive structure at each level.  The rules of type theory are now
interpreted in \C rather than $\mathcal{S}$, so that each type has an
$\infty$-groupoid structure \emph{as well as} a separate cohesive
structure on its objects, morphisms, morphisms between morphisms, etc.
As in the 1-categorical case, $\Gamma$ forgets the cohesive structure,
and $\Delta$ and $\nabla$ equip an $\infty$-groupoid with the discrete
and codiscrete cohesion.  But in the $\infty$-categorical case,
$\Delta$'s left adjoint $\sh A$ (pronounced ``shape of $A$'')
generalizes from the connected components to the \emph{fundamental
  $\infty$-groupoid} functor, which makes an algebraic $\infty$-groupoid
from the \emph{cohesive} paths, paths between paths, etc. of $A$.  Using
some axioms for cohesion, one can prove, for example, that the shape of
the topological circle is the algebraic circle, which allows synthetic
homotopy theory to be used in proofs about topological
spaces~\citep{s15}, and opens up additional possibilities for using
synthetic homotopy theory as a tool in other areas of mathematics and
theoretical physics.

This paper begins an investigation into the structural proof theory of
cohesive homotopy type theory, as a special case of generalizing Reed's
adjoint logic to allow multiple adjunctions between two categories.
From a proof-theoretic perspective the $\Gamma$ in a triple adjunction
$\Delta \la \Gamma \la \nabla$ is a bit of an odd duck, because it is
both a right and a left adjoint, and so should behave like both the $F$
and $U$ in adjoint logic.  One possibility would be to design rules for
a left-and-right-adjoint connective.  However, such a connective would
need to have an unusual focusing~\citep{andreoli92focus} behavior: In
any adjunction, left adjoints preserve colimits (e.g. coproducts) and
right adjoints preserve limits (e.g. products).  In focusing, limits are
negative connectives (invertible on the right, focus on the left), while
colimits are positive connectives (invertible on the left, focus on the
right), and in general like-polarity connectives compose together well.
Reed's adjoint logic is compatible with these two facts, because it
admits a focusing interpretation where the left adjoint $F$ is positive
and the right adjoint $U$ is negative.  However, if $\Gamma$ is both a
left and a right adjoint, it seems like it would need to be both
positive and negative.  

Instead of giving rules for an ambipolar connective, we will provide a
logic in which this comes true up to isomorphism: we can describe a quadruple
\[
F \la U \cong F' \la U'
\]
and then define $\Delta := F$, $\nabla := U'$, $\Gamma := U \cong F'$.
That is, the functor $\Gamma$ will be defined to be one of two naturally
isomorphic functors, one of which is a left adjoint/positive and the
other of which is a right adjoint/negative.  This idea is present in
Reed's encoding of labeled deduction~\citep[Section ?]{reed09adjoint},
where two modes $p,q$ such that $p \ge q$ and $q \ge p$ give rise to
adjunctions $F \la U$ and $F' \la U'$ such that $F \cong U'$ and $U
\cong F'$.  However, in the case of an adjoint triple, we want $U \cong
F'$ but not $F \cong U'$, because $\Delta$ and $\nabla$ are not the
same.  

The first step in enriching the mode specifications to cover this case
is to generalize the mode preorder to a mode category, so that we can
have multiple different morphisms $p \ge q$, and therefore we can have
$p \ge q$ and $q \ge p$ without $p$ being isomorphic to $q$.  However, a
1-category of modes is not enough to capture the relationships between
these different adjunctions---we need to say that $U \cong F'$ but not
$F \cong U'$.  To accomplish this, we consider a 

Definitional vs. propositional equality of proofs.

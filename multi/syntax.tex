\caption{Syntax for mode theories}
\label{fig:2multicategory}
\end{figure}

The first layer of the logic is a type theory whose types we will call
\emph{modes}, and whose terms we will call \emph{context descriptors} or
\emph{mode morphisms}.  We begin with a simple type theory with
variables and constants, as described in
Figure~\ref{fig:2multicategory}.  We assume a fixed signature $\Sigma$
of constants \dsd{c}, and we write $\oftp{\psi}{\alpha}{q}$ for context
descriptor well-formedness and $\oftp{\psi}{\gamma}{\psi'}$ for
substitution well-formedness.  The context $\psi$ here enjoys the
cartesian structural properties (associativity, unit, weakening,
exchange, contraction).  Simultaneous substitution into terms is defined
as usual.

Next, we need a notation for presenting object-logic structural
properties, which, as described above, will in general be directed
transformations between context descriptors.  For
\oftp{\psi}{\alpha,\alpha'}{p}, we define a judgement
     {\wfsp{\psi}{\alpha}{\alpha'}{p}} representing such
     transformations; it is the least precongruence (preorder compatible
     with the term formers) closed under axioms specified in a signature
     $\Sigma$.  For example, to say that a mode $p$ with a context
     monoid $(\odot,1)$ is affine, we would specify in $\Sigma$ a
     transformation \wfsp{x:p}{x}{1}{p}.  Then, using the rules in the
     figure, we can for example derive a transformation $(x \odot y)
     \spr (1 \odot y) \spr y$ that, when applied (contravariantly) to a
     sequent, will allow weakening $y$ to $x \odot y$.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:semantics}, we will eventually need an
equational theory between two structural property derivations $s \deq s'
:: \wfsp{\psi}{\alpha}{\alpha'}{q}$.  Because this equational theory
does not influence provability in the sequent calculus, only identity of
proofs, we defer the details.

One choice in the design of this language of context descriptors is how
to handle symmetric structural properties.  One possibility is to
present a desired equation $\alpha = \alpha'$ as an isomorphism, with
axioms $s : \alpha \spr \alpha'$ and $s' : \alpha' \spr \alpha$ (and,
writing $s_1;s_2$ for derivations by the above transitivity rule,
equations $s;s' = 1_{\alpha}$ and $s';s = 1_{\alpha'}$).  While this is
conceptually and technically sufficient, we have found it helpful in
examples to also use a ``strict'' equality of context descriptors which
is implicitly respected by all types and judgements.  This simplifies
the description of some situations, though the difference is important
mainly at the level of identity of derivations rather than
provability---for example, we can make a binary operation $\odot$ into a
strict monoid, rather than adding associator and unitor isomorphisms,
which requires more equations between structural transformations.  To
support this, we allow $\Sigma$ to contain axioms for equations $\alpha
\deq \beta$ and define a judgement $\psi \vdash \alpha \deq \beta : p$
as the least congruence containing these axioms (i.e. the rules for
$\spr$ plus symmetry).  Because the context descriptors and their
equality are defined independently of any subsequent judgements, we take
the liberty of suppressing this equality by using $\alpha$ to refer to a
context-descriptor-modulo-\deq---that is, we assume a metatheory with
quotient sets/types, and use meta-level equality for object-level
equality, as recently advocated by \citet{altenkirchkaposi16qit}.  For
example, because the judgement \wfsp{\psi}{\alpha}{\beta}{p} is indexed
by equivalence classes of context descriptions, the reflexivity rule
above implicitly means $\alpha \deq \beta$ implies $\alpha \spr \beta$.

A signature $\Sigma$ consisting of some number of constants $c$,
equations $\alpha \deq \beta$, transformations $\alpha \spr \beta$ (and
equalities of transformations $s \deq s'$) specifies a \emph{mode theory}.

\caption{Sequent Calculus}
\label{fig:sequent}
\hrule
\end{figure}

The whole sequent calculus is parametrized by a mode theory $\Sigma$,
which is an implicit argument to all of the definitions in
Figure~\ref{fig:sequent}.  The first judgement assigns each
proposition/type $A$ a mode $p$.  Encodings of non-modal logics will
generally only make use of one mode, while modal logics use different
modes to represent different notions of truth, such as the linear and
cartesian categories in the adjoint decomposition of linear
logic~\citep{benton94mixed,bentonwadler96adjoint} and the true/valid/lax
judgements in modal logic~\citep{pfenningdavies}.  The next judgement
assigns each context $\Gamma$ a mode context $\psi$.  Formally, we think
of contexts as ordered: we do not regard $x:A,y:B$ and $y:B,x:A$ as the
same context, though we will have an admissible exchange rule that
passes between derivations in one and the other.

The sequent judgement \seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A} relates a context
$\wfctx{\Gamma}{\psi}$ and a type $\wftype{A}{p}$ and context descriptor
\oftp{\psi}{\alpha}{p}, while the substitution relates
$\wfctx{\Gamma}{\psi}$ and $\wfctx{\Delta}{\psi'}$ and
$\oftp{\psi}{\gamma}{\psi'}$. Because $\wfctx{\Gamma}{\psi}$ means that
each variable in $\Gamma$ is in $\psi$, where $x : A_i \in \Gamma$
implies $x : p_i$ in $\psi$ with \wftype{A_i}{p_i}, we think of $\Gamma$
as binding variable names both in $\alpha$ and for use in the
derivation.

As discussed in the introduction, a guiding principle is to make the
following rules admissible (see Section~\ref{sec:synprop-long} for
details), which express respect for structural transformations and
structurality-over-structurality:
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\infer[Lem~\ref{lem:respectspr}]{\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A}}
      {\alpha \spr \beta &
       \seq{\Gamma}{\beta}{A}}
\qquad
\infer[Thm~\ref{thm:identity}]{\seq{\Gamma,x:A}{x}{A}}{}
\qquad
\infer[Thm~\ref{thm:cut}]{\seq{\Gamma}{\subst{\beta}{\alpha}{x}}{B}}
    {\seq{\Gamma,x:A}{\beta}{B} &
     \seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A}}
\\ \\
\infer[Lem~\ref{lem:weakening}]{\seq{\Gamma,y:A}{\alpha}{C}}
      {\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{C}}
\quad
\infer[Lem~\ref{lem:exchange}]{\seq{\Gamma,y:B,x:A}{\alpha}{C}}
      {\seq{\Gamma,x:A,y:B}{\alpha}{C}}
\qquad
\infer[Cor~\ref{cor:contraction}]{\seq{\Gamma,x:A}{\subst \alpha x y}{C}}
      {\seq{\Gamma,x:A,y:A}{\alpha}{C}}
\end{array}
\]

We now explain the rules for the sequent calculus; the reader may wish
to refer to the examples in Section~\ref{sec:exampleencodings} in
parallel with this abstract description.

We assume atomic propositions $P$ are given a specified mode $p$, and
state identity as a primitive rule only for them.  If we had instead
stated the identity rule as \seq{\Gamma,x:P}{x}{P}, then respect for
structural transformation would not be admissible, so we allow a $\beta
\spr x$ premise here.  Using a structural property at a leaf of a
derivation is common in e.g. affine logic, where the derivation of
$\beta \spr x$ would use weakening to forget any additional resources.

Next, we consider the \F{\alpha}{\Delta} type, which ``internalizes''
the context operation $\alpha$ as a type/proposition.  Syntactically, we
view the context $\Delta = x_1:A_1,\ldots,x_n:A_n$ where
\wftype{A_i}{p_i} as binding the variables $x_i:p_i$ in $\alpha$, so for
example \F{\alpha}{x:A,y:B} and \F{\alpha[x \leftrightarrow
    x']}{x':A,y:B} are $\alpha$-equivalent types (in de Bruijn form we
would write \F{\alpha}{A_1,\ldots,A_n} and use indices in $\alpha$).
The type formation rule says that \dsd{F} moves covariantly along a mode
morphism $\alpha$, representing a ``product'' (in a loose sense) of the
types in $\Delta$ structured according to the context descriptor
$\alpha$. A typical binary instance of \dsd{F} is a multiplicative
product ($A \otimes B$ in linear logic), which, given a binary context
descriptor $\odot$ as in the introduction, is written \F{x \odot
  y}{x:A,y:B}.  A typical nullary instance is a unit (1 in linear
logic), written \F{1}{}.  A typical unary instance is the \dsd{F}
connective of adjoint logic, which for a unary context descriptor
constant $\dsd{f} : \dsd{p} \to \dsd{q}$ is written \F{\dsd{f}(x)}{x:A}.
We sometimes write \F{\dsd{f}}{A} in this case, eliding the variable
name, and similarly for a unary \dsd{U}.

The rules for our \dsd{F} connective capture a pattern common to all of
these examples.  The left \FL rule says that \F{\alpha}{\Delta}
``decays'' into $\Delta$, but \emph{structuring the uses of resources in
  $\Delta$ with $\alpha$ by the substitution \subst{\beta}{\alpha}{x}}.
We assume that $\Delta$ is $\alpha$-renamed to avoid collision with
$\Gamma$ (the proof term here would be a ``\dsd{split}'' that binds
variables for each position in $\Delta$).  The placement of $\Delta$ at
the right of the context is arbitrary (because we have
exchange-over-exchange), but we follow the convention that new variables
go on the right to emphasize that $\Gamma$ behaves mostly as in ordinary
cartesian logic.  The right \FR\/ rule says that you must rewrite (using
structural transformations) the context descriptor to have an $\alpha$
at the outside, with a mode substitution $\gamma$ that divides the
existing resources up between the positions in $\Delta$, and then prove
each formula in $\Delta$ using the specified resources.  We leave the
typing of $\gamma$ implicit, though there is officially a requirement
$\oftp{\psi}{\gamma}{\psi'}$ where $\wfctx{\Gamma}{\psi}$ and
$\wfctx{\Delta}{\psi'}$, as required for the second premise to be a
well-formed sequent.  Another way to understand this rule is to begin
with the ``axiomatic \FR''
\[
\infer[\FR^*]{\seq{\Delta}{\alpha}{\F{\alpha}{\Delta}}}{}
\]
which says that there is a map from $\Delta$ to \F{\alpha}{\Delta} along
$\alpha$.  Then, in the same way that a typical right rule for
coproducts builds a precomposition into an ``axiomatic injection'' such
as $\dsd{inl} :: A \vdash A + B$, the \FR\/ rule builds a precomposition
with $\seq{\Gamma}{\gamma}{\Delta}$ and then an application of a
structural rule $\beta \spr \alpha[\gamma]$ into the ``axiomatic''
version, in order to make cut and respect for transformations
admissible.

Next, we turn to $\U{x.\alpha}{\Delta}{A}$.  As a first approximation,
if we ignore the context descriptors and structural properties,
\U{-}{\Delta}{A} behaves like $\Delta \to A$, and the \UL\/ and \UR\/
rules are an annotation of the usual structural/cartesian rules for
implication.  In a formula \U{x.\alpha}{\Delta}{A}, the context
descriptor $\alpha$ has access to the variables from $\Delta$ as well as
an extra variable $x$, whose mode is the same as the \emph{overall mode
  of \U{x.\alpha}{\Delta}{A}}, while the mode of $A$ itself is the mode
of the conclusion of $\alpha$---in terms of typing, \dsd{U} is
contravariant where \dsd{F} is covariant.  It is helpful to think of $x$
as standing for the context that will be used to prove
\U{x.\alpha}{\Delta}{A}.  For example, a typical function type $A \lolli
B$ is represented by \U{x.x \otimes y}{y:A}{B}, which says to extend the
``current context'' $x$ with a resource $y$.  In \UR, the context
descriptor $\beta$ being used to prove the \dsd{U} is substituted
\emph{for $x$} in $\alpha$ (dual to \FL, which substituted $\alpha$ into
$\beta$).  The ``axiomatic'' \UL\/ instance
\[
\infer[\UL^*]{\seq{\Delta,x:\U{x.\alpha}{\Delta}{A}}{\alpha}{A}}{}
\]
says that \U{x.\alpha}{\Delta}{A} together with $\Delta$ has a map to
$A$ along $\alpha$.  (The bound $x$ in $x.\alpha$ subscript is tacitly
renamed to match the name of the assumption in the context, in the same
way that the typing rule for $\lambda x.e : \Pi x:A.B$ requires
coordination between two variables in different scopes).  The full rule
builds in precomposition with \seq{\Gamma}{\gamma}{\Delta},
postcomposition with \seq{\Gamma,z:A}{\beta'}{C}, and precomposition
with a structural transformation $\beta \spr \beta'[\alpha[\gamma]/z]$.

Finally, the rules for substitutions are pointwise.  In examples, we
will write the components of a substitution directly as multiple
premises of \FR\/ and \UL\/, eliding packaging them into a list with the
$\_,\_$ and $\cdot$ rules.

One subtle point about the $\FL$ rule is that there are two competing
principles: making the rules ``obviously'' structural-over-structural,
and reducing inessential non-determinism.  Here, we choose the later,
and treat the assumption of \F{\alpha}{\Delta} affinely, removing it
from the context when it is used.  It will turn out that the judgement
nonetheless enjoys contraction-over-contraction
(Corollary~\ref{cor:contraction}), because contraction
for negatives is built into the \UL-rule, and contraction for positives
follows from this and the fact that we can always reconstruct a positive
from what it decays to on the left (c.f. how purely positive formulas
have contraction in linear logic).

Additives can be added to this sequent calculus; e.g. a mode $p$ has
sums $\wftype{A_p + B_p}{p}$ if
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\infer{\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A + B}}
      {\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A}}
\quad
\infer{\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A + B}}
      {\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{B}}
\quad
\infer{\seq{\Gamma,x:A+B,\Gamma'}{\beta}{C}}
      {\seq{\Gamma,\Gamma',y:A}{\subst \beta y x}{C} &
       \seq{\Gamma,\Gamma',z:B}{\subst \beta z x}{C} 
      }
%% \infer{\wftype{A \& B}{p}}
%%       {\wftype{A}{p} &
%%        \wftype{B}{p}}
%% \qquad
%% \infer{\seq{\Gamma,x:A \& B}{\alpha}{C}}
%%       {\seq{\Gamma,y:A}{\alpha[y/x]}{C}}
%% \quad
%% \infer{\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A + B}}
%%       {\seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{B}}
\end{array}
\]

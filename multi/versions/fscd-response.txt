We thank the reviewers very much for their detailed and helpful
feedback, which will greatly improve the next revision of this paper.
We will add the discussion below to the paper.

-- Review 1 --

* What benefits does the framework provides relative to existing
  instances of it?  We can say that we have found it quite useful for
  designing several new "modal homotopy type theories", of which we
  included one representative example (spatial type theory, Sec
  3.5). But there are others, involving modalities and products with
  different properties, and which use mode theories with interesting
  2 cells.

* Can the framework express functors that are not monads or comonads?
  Yes, and we apologize for the misleading phrasing.  For a general
  unary mode morphism f, F_f and U_f are adjoint functors, which are not
  necessarily monoidal but can be made monoidal by adding structural
  rules.  For a functor ! without an adjoint, one can consider proofs
  that avoid mentioning either F_f or U_f.  Such proofs can be
  interpreted in a setting with only a functor ! (satsifying whatever
  structural rules are asserted by the mode theory, e.g. monoidalness).
  Technically, this is why, in Definition 5.4, we first define what it
  means for a local discrete fibration to "have \mu-products" and "have
  \mu-homs" for a particular mode morphism \mu (independently from each
  other).  A bifibration has all \mu products and homs, but one can
  consider a local discrete fibration with only some of them, when
  non-adjoint modalities are of interest.

* Is it difficult to add sums?  We would just emphasize that additive
  coproducts and products do not need to be considered separately for
  each mode theory.  The rules for coproducts are on page 7 of the
  submission, and similar rules can be given for products, and the
  admissible properties (cut) continue to hold for these connectives,
  independently of the mode theory.  In our view, additives are
  fundamentally different from F and U, which codify multiplicatives and
  exponentials, because additives are about the choice between multiple
  focus rules for a connective.

* What are the prospects for extensions, e.g. to first order
  quantifiers, and structured conclusions (as in classical or display
  logic)?  Work on this is in progress, and it certainly seems possible
  but not obvious.  We have focused on the single-conclusioned case
  because our main motivating examples are extensions of intuitionistic
  type theory.

* Why sequent calculus as opposed to natural deduction?  We chose to use
  a sequent calculus only because of the simplicity of defining
  cut-free/normal forms---in natural deduction, we would need two
  "normal" and "neutral" judgements, whereas here left and right rules
  play that role.  We can include the natural deduction rules in the revision.

-- Review 2 --

* Do concrete models support the bifibration structure?
  Section 9 of the extended version can be read as a syntactic version
  of such a result, showing that the syntax specialized to the ordered
  logic mode theory (a monoid) presents the free monoidal category.

* What limitations are there?  We will add a discussion of first-order
  quantifiers and multi-conclusioned sequents to the conclusion.
  Scaling to dependent types is challenging because it is not even clear
  what the patterns of substructural and modal type dependency that a
  framework should capture are.  We are in the process of considering a
  number of examples of modal homotopy type theories, including the
  spatial type theory described here, variations on it, and a directed
  type theory where types are categories rather than groupoids.  In each
  of these, we have used a mode theory to guide the simply-typed rules,
  and then generalized to dependent types "manually".  We plan to codify
  these examples once we have enough instances to know what a successful
  framework should cover.
  
-- Review 3 --

* What were the difficulties in generalizing our previous work on
  one-variable logic?  We can only say that it took several tries to
  come up with a well-behaved multi-variable generalization, and that
  our early attempts (by adding products to the mode category instead of
  using multicategories) did not satisfy cut admissibility or had other
  explicit structural rules that could not be fused with the connective
  rules.  In addition to the design of the sequent calculus itself, the
  precise formulation of the equational theory and the semantic
  structures both took some care.  Finally, it was not obvious that
  encodings would be adequate in senses we prove in the extended
  version, because these proofs rely on a strengthening lemma showing
  that "unusable" variables (in the sense of the context descriptor) do
  not matter.

* How does our semantics compare to full Lambek hyperdoctrines as
  considered by Maruyama?  Thanks for the reference!  We can add a
  comparison in the revision, though at a quick skim this looks more
  relevant to a first-order generalization of our current propositional
  framework.

\section{Conclusion}

We have described a sequent calculus that can express a variety of
substructural and modal logics through a suitable choice of mode theory.
The framework itself enjoys identity and cut admissibility for all mode
theories, and these properties are inherited by the logics that are
represented in it.  The logic corresponds semantically to a fibration
between 2-dimensional cartesian multicategories, and so gives both a
syntactic and semantic account of the idea that substructural and modal
logics are constraints on structural proofs.

%% In future work, we will
%% investigate the issue of equality of derivations, leading to an
%% initiality theorem with respect to the semantic structure, and to a
%% better understanding of how the equality of derivations in the framework
%% corresponds to object-language equality of proofs/programs/morphisms.

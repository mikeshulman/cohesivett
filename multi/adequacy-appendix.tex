The following lemma is helpful for many adequacy proofs.  It says that
for many mode theories 0-use variables can be strengthened away.  

\begin{lemma}[0-use Strengthing] \label{lem:0-use-strengthening}
We say that a formula $\F{\alpha}{\Delta}$ and \U{c.\alpha}{\Delta}{A}
is relevant if every variable from $\Delta$ (and $c$ for \Usymb) occurs
at least once in $\alpha$.

Suppose the mode theory has the property that for all $x$, $\alpha$,
$\beta$, if $\alpha \spr \beta$ and $x \# \alpha$ then $x \# \beta$ (in
particular, equations must have the same variables on both sides).
Suppose additionally a sequent \seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A} such that every
\Fsymb/\Usymb\/ subformula of $\Gamma,A$ is relevant.

Then if $\D :: \seq{\Gamma}{\alpha}{A}$ and $\vec{x}$ are variables such
that $\vec{x} \# \alpha$ then there is a $\D' ::
\seq{\Gamma-\vec{x}}{\alpha}{A}$ and $size(\D') \le size(\D)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on $\D$.  In all cases, the assumption that
every formula is relevant is preserved for all premises of a rule by the
subformula property.

\begin{itemize}
\item In the case for a variable $x:P$ with transformation $\beta \spr
  x$, we need to show that the variable $x$ being used is not one of the
  ones being strengthened away.  But if $x$ were in $\vec{x}$, then we
  would have $x \# \beta$, and therefore by the assumption, $x \# x$, a
  contradiction.  Therefore $x \in {\Gamma-\vec{x}}$, and we can reapply
  the variable rule, which has the same size.

\item In the case for \FR, we have $\vec{x} \# \beta$, so by the
  reduction condition, $\vec{x} \# \alpha[\gamma]$.  By the relevance
  condition, all variables that $\gamma$ substitutes occur in $\alpha$,
  which means each component of $\gamma$ occurs in $\alpha[\gamma]$.
  Therefore $\vec{x} \# \gamma$.  We can use the inductive hypothesis to
  obtain a no-bigger derivation of \seq{\Gamma-\vec{x}}{\gamma}{\Delta},
  and then reapply \FR.

\item In the case for \FL, we distinguish cases on whether $x \in
  \vec{x}$ or not.

  If it is, then this is an elimination on a 0-use variable that we
  would like to drop.  Because $x \# \beta$, $\beta[\alpha/x] = \beta$,
  and note that $\Delta \# \beta$ because it occurs only in $\alpha$.
  Thus, if we appeal to the inductive hypothesis on the premise with
  $\vec{x}-x,\Delta$, we get
  \seq{(\Gamma,\Gamma',\Delta)-(\vec{x}-x,\Delta)}{\beta}{C}, 
  i.e.
  \seq{\Gamma,x:\F{\alpha}{\Delta},\Gamma',-\vec{x}}{\beta}{C}
  as desired.  That is, we recursively drop all variables that came from
  the elimination, in addition to any others that we were trying to drop
  besides $\vec{x}$.  

  If it is not, then $\vec{x} \# \beta$ and $\vec{x} \# \alpha$ (by
  scoping) implies $\vec{x} \# \beta[\alpha/x]$, so by the inductive
  hypothesis we get a no-bigger derivation of
  \seq{\Gamma,\Gamma'-\vec{x},\Delta}{\beta[\alpha/x]}{C}, and we can
  reapply \FL (because the principal variable $x$ of the left rule is
  not removed).

\item In the case for \UR, we have $\vec{x}$ a collection of variables
  bound in $\Gamma$, so $\vec{x} \# \alpha$ (since the domain of
  $\alpha$ is not $\Gamma$) in addition to $\vec{x} \# \beta$.  Thus
  $\vec{x} \# \alpha{\beta}{x}$, so the inductive hypothesis gives a
  no-bigger derivation of
  \seq{\Gamma-\vec{x},\Delta}{\alpha[\beta/x]}{A}, and we can reapply
  the rule.

\item In the case for \UL, we distinguish cases on whether $z$ occurs in
  $\beta'$.  

  If $z \# \beta'$, then this \UL is generating a 0-use assumption $z$, so
  we can remove it and the \UL along with $\vec{x}$.  That is, we appeal
  to the inductive hypothesis on the continuation with $\vec{x},z$,
  which gives \seq{\Gamma,z:A-(\vec{x},z)}{\beta'}{C}, i.e.
  \seq{\Gamma,\vec{x}}{\beta'}{C}.  We also have $\beta \spr \beta'$
  because the $[\alpha[\gamma]/z]$ substitution cancels.  So we have
  \seq{\Gamma,\vec{x}}{\beta}{C} by Lemma~\ref{lem:respectspr}.
  
  If $z$ occurs in $\beta'$, we further distinguish cases on whether $x
  \in \vec{x}$ or not.  

  If it is not, then we know $\vec{x} \# \beta$, so pushing this along
  the transformation gives $\vec{x} \# \beta'[\alpha[\gamma]/z]$.  Thus
  $\vec{x} \# \beta'$ (note that $z$ cannot be in $\vec{x}$ because it
  is bound only in the continuation), and because $z$ occurs in
  $\beta'$, $\alpha[\gamma/z]$ occurs in the substitution, so $\vec{x}
  \# \alpha[\gamma]$.  By the relevance assumption, each term in
  $\gamma$ also occurs after the substitution, so $\vec{x} \# \gamma$ as
  well.  Thus, by the inductive hypotheses we get no-bigger derivations
  of \seq{\Gamma-\vec{x}}{\gamma}{\Delta} and
  \seq{\Gamma-\vec{x},z:A}{\beta'}{C}, and the principal $x$ survives in
  $\Gamma-\vec{x}$, so we can reapply \UL.

  Finally, if $x \in \vec{x}$ and $z \in \beta'$, then we have $x \#
  \beta$, so $x \# \beta'[\alpha[\gamma]/z]$ by moving along the
  transformation, and then $x \# \alpha[\gamma]$ by the fact that $z$
  occurs.  However, this contradicts the relevance assumption on
  $\U{x.\alpha}{\Delta}{A}$, which says that $x$ occurs in $\alpha$.  
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:spr-doesnt-introduce}
Suppose each axiom $c : \alpha \spr \beta$ has the property that $x \#
\alpha$ implies $x \# \beta$.  Then for any derivation of $\alpha \spr
\beta$, $x \# \alpha$ implies $x \# \beta$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The cases for reflexivity is immediate, and the case for axioms is
assumed.  In the case for transitivity $\alpha \spr \beta_1 \spr
\beta_2$, we get $\vec{x} \# \beta_1$ by the first inductive hypothesis
and then $\vec{x} \# \beta_2$ by the second.  In the case for
congruence, we have $\vec{x} \# \alpha[\beta/y]$.  This means that
either $\vec{x} \# \alpha$ and $\vec{x} \# \beta$, or $\vec{x} \#
\alpha$ and $y \# \alpha$ (in which case $\vec{x}$ might occur in
$\beta$).  In the first case, we get $\vec{x} \# \alpha'$ and $\vec{x}
\# \beta'$ by the inductive hypotheses, so $\vec{x} \#
\alpha'[\beta'/y]$.  In the second, we get $\vec{x},y \# \alpha'$ by the
inductive hypothesis, so $\alpha'[\beta'/y] = \alpha'$, and $\vec{x} \#
\alpha'$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Affine Logic}

Consider the following rules for affine logic, where the context is
represented by a list of assumptions labeled with variables, and $\Gamma
\splits \Delta_1,\Delta_2$ means interleaving $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$
in some order equals $\Gamma$.

\begin{small}
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\infer{\seqa{\Gamma}{P}}{P \in \Gamma}
\qquad
\infer{\seqa{\Gamma,z:A\otimes B,\Gamma'}{C}}
      {\seqa{\Gamma,\Gamma',x:A,y:B}{C}}
\qquad
\infer{\seqa{\Gamma}{A \otimes B}}
      {\Gamma \splits \Delta_1;\Delta_2 &
        \seqa{\Delta_1}{A} &
        \seqa{\Delta_2}{B}}
\\\\
\infer{\seqa{\Gamma}{A \lolli B}}
      {\seqa{\Gamma,x:A}{B}}
\qquad
\infer{\seqa{\Gamma}{C}}
      {\Gamma \splits \Delta_1;\Delta_2;(f:A \lolli B) &
        \seqa{\Delta_1}{A} &
        \seqa{\Delta_2,z:B}{C}
      }
\end{array}
\]
\end{small}

\noindent Weakening and exchange are admissible for these rules.  

Using the mode theory from Section~\ref{sec:ex:affine}, we translate the
propositions and contexts of adjoint logic as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
P^* & = & P \\
(A\otimes B)^* & = & \F{x \otimes y}{x:A^*,y:B^*} \\
(A\lolli B)^* & = & \U{c.c \otimes x}{x:A^*}{B^*} \\
\\
\cdot^* & = & \cdot\\
(\Gamma,x:A)^* & = & \Gamma^*,x:A^*\\
\end{array}
\]
We also define a function that collects the variables from $\Gamma$ as a
context descriptor:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vars{\cdot} & = & 1\\
\vars{(\Gamma,x:A)} & = & \vars{\Gamma} \otimes x\\
\end{array}
\]

Overall, we have
\begin{theorem}[Adequacy of provability for $\seqa{}{}$] ~\\
$\seqa{\Gamma}{A}$ iff $\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

The forward direction is by induction on $\seqa{\Gamma}{A}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item For the hypothesis rule, we need to show
  \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{P}.  Because $x$ is in $\Gamma$, we can
  prove by induction on $\Gamma$ that $x:P$ is in $\Gamma^*$ and that
  $\vars{\Gamma} \deq \alpha \otimes x$.  Thus, the weakening
  transformation gives $\alpha \otimes x \spr 1 \otimes x \deq
  x$. Therefore we can derive
\[
\infer[\dsd{v}]
      {\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{P}}
      {x:P \in \Gamma & 
        {\vars{\Gamma}} \spr x}
\]

\item For $\otimes$-left, the inductive hypothesis gives
\seq{\Gamma^*,\Gamma'^*,x:A^*,y:B^*}{\vars{\Gamma} \otimes \vars{\Gamma'} \otimes x \otimes y}{C^*}
and we want 
\seq{\Gamma^*,z:\F{x\otimes y}{x:A^*,y:B^*},\Gamma'^*}{\vars{\Gamma} \otimes z \otimes \vars{\Gamma'}}{C^*}.
This is \FL\/ on the inductive hypothesis, with using associativity and commutativity of
$\otimes$ from the mode theory to move $x \otimes y$ to the end.  

\item 
For $\otimes$-right, we 
have \seq{\Delta_1^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A^*}
and \seq{\Delta_2^*}{\vars{\Delta_2}}{B^*} by the inductive hypotheses,
which we can weaken to
 \seq{\Delta_1^*,\Delta_2^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A^*}
and 
 \seq{\Delta_1^*,\Delta_2^*}{\vars{\Delta_2}}{B^*}, 
and then exchange to 
 \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A^*}
and 
 \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Delta_2}}{B^*} (using a lemma that when $\Gamma \splits \Delta_1,\Delta_2$,
$\Gamma$ and $(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)$ differ only in order, and that
 reordering is preserved by the mapped application of $*$).  
To apply \FR\/ to derive \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{\F{x \otimes y}{x:A,y:B}}, it thus suffices to show that 
$\vars{\Gamma} \spr \vars{\Delta_1}\otimes\vars{\Delta_2}$.  In fact
they are $\deq$,  which we can
prove by induction on $\Gamma \splits \Delta_1,\Delta_2$ using the
commutative monoid laws.  

\item For $\lolli$-right, we have
  \seq{\Gamma^*,x:A^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\otimes x}{B^*}
by the inductive hypothesis, which is exactly the premise of using \UR\/
to prove
  \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{\U{c.c\otimes x}{x:A^*}{B^*}}.  

\item For $\lolli$-left, we have \seq{\Delta_1^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A}
  and \seq{\Delta_2^*,z:B^*}{\vars{\Delta_2}\otimes z}{C^*} by the
  inductive hypothesis, and by similar reasoning to the $\otimes R$
  case, we can weaken and exchange to
  \seq{\Gamma^*,\Gamma'^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A} and
  \seq{\Gamma^*,\Gamma'^*,z:B^*}{\vars{\Delta_2}\otimes z}{C^*} and then
  finally weaken to \seq{\Gamma^*,f:(A\lolli
    B)^*,\Gamma'^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A} and \seq{\Gamma^*,f:(A\lolli
    B)^*,\Gamma'^*,z:B^*}{\vars{\Delta_2}\otimes z}{C^*}.
Thus, we only need to show the transformation premise of
\[
\infer[\UL]{\seq{\Gamma^*,f:(A\lolli B)^*,\Gamma'^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\otimes f \otimes \vars{\Gamma'}}{C^*}}
      {  
        \begin{array}{l}
        {\vars{\Gamma}\otimes f \otimes \vars{\Gamma'}} \spr
        (\vars{\Delta_2} \otimes z)[f \otimes \vars{\Delta_1} /z] \\
        \seq{\Gamma^*,f:(A\lolli B)^*,\Gamma'^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A} \\
        \seq{\Gamma^*,f:(A\lolli B)^*,\Gamma'^*,z:B^*}{\vars{\Delta_2}\otimes z}{C^*}
        \end{array}
      }
\]
In fact 
${\vars{\Gamma}\otimes f \otimes \vars{\Gamma'}} \deq (\vars{\Delta_2} \otimes f \otimes \vars{\Delta_1})$,
which again follows from $\Gamma \splits \Delta_1,\Delta_2$, using associativity and commutativity
of $\otimes$.  
\end{itemize}
In terms of structural property placement, observe that the above proof
uses only identity transformations on \FR\/ and \UL, and uses the
\dsd{w} axiom only at the leaves.  

In the converse direction, we generalize slightly and prove 
\begin{quote}
If $\Gamma_0 \ge \Gamma$ and $\seq{\Gamma_0^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*}$ then
$\seqa{\Gamma}{A}$
\end{quote}
where $\Gamma_0 \ge \Gamma$ means that $\Gamma_0$ contains every
assumption $x:A$ that $\Gamma$ does and possibly more (i.e. $\Gamma_0$
is a weakening of an exchange of $\Gamma$); this is a preorder.  That
is, we allow the actual context of the encoding to contain more
assumptions than the context descriptor, but all of those assumptions
will be of a type that is in the image of the translation of affine
logic.  This is necessary because of the contraction in \UL, where the
function is removed from the descriptor but not from the context itself.
The reason exchange is needed here is that commutativity can be applied
at any point in a derivation so if we start with a derivation with
context descriptor ${\vars{\Gamma}}$, the premises might always be some
exchange of it.

We need the following facts about the mode theory.  

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:affine-mode-1}
If $\alpha \spr \beta$ then $\alpha \deq \beta \otimes \beta'$
for some $\beta'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

In the case for weakening $\alpha \spr 1$ (the only axiom), take
$\beta' = \beta$.  In the case for reflexivity take $\beta' =
1$.  In the case for transitivity, we have $\alpha \spr \beta_1
\spr \beta_2$.  By the second inductive hypothesis, we have
$\beta_1 \deq \beta_2 \otimes \beta_2'$, and by the first we have
$\alpha \deq \beta_1 \otimes \beta_1'$, so 
$\alpha \deq \beta_2 \otimes (\beta_2' \otimes \beta_1')$.  

In the case for congruence, we have
$\alpha_1[\alpha_2/x] \spr \beta_1[\beta_2/x]$
and the inductive hypotheses give
    $\alpha_1 \deq \beta_1 \otimes \beta_1'$
and $\alpha_2 \deq \beta_2 \otimes \beta_2'$.  
Thus, 
$\alpha_1[\alpha_2/x] \deq \beta_1[\beta_2 \otimes \beta_2'/x] \otimes \beta_1'[\beta_2 \otimes \beta_2'/x]$,
and then the right-hand side equals 
$\beta_1[\beta_2/x] \otimes \beta_2^n \otimes \beta_1'[\beta_2 \otimes \beta_2'/x]$
for some $n$.  
This is because, 
for this mode theory, we can rewrite any $\alpha$ as $\alpha' \otimes (x
\otimes \ldots \otimes x)$ where $\alpha'$ does not contain $x$ (because
any context descriptor is equal to a ``polynomial'' giving the
multiplicity of each variable), so in general we have $\alpha[\beta_1
  \otimes \beta_2/x] \deq \alpha' \otimes (\beta_1 \otimes \beta_2)^n
\deq \alpha' \otimes \beta_1^n \otimes \beta_2^n \deq \alpha[\beta_1/x]
\otimes \beta_2^n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:affine-mode-5}
If $\vars{\Gamma} \deq \alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2$, 
then $\Gamma \splits \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ with 
$\vars{\Gamma_1} \deq \alpha_1$ 
and $\vars{\Gamma_2} \deq \alpha_2$.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We define the splitting $\Gamma \splits \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ adding each
variable in $\Gamma$ to $\Gamma_1$ if it occurs in $\alpha_1$, or
$\Gamma_2$ if it occurs in $\alpha_2$ and not $\alpha_1$ (occurrence
respects \deq).  Because $\deq$ is associativity, commutativity, and
unit, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ have no duplicates and every variable
from \vars{\Gamma} occurs exactly once in one or the other, which gives
$\vars{\Gamma_1} \deq \alpha_1$ and $\vars{\Gamma_2} \deq \alpha_1$.
%% FIXME: last sentence is a little sketchy
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:affine-mode-4}
If $\vars{\Gamma} \spr \alpha$, then there is a $\Gamma'$ such that
$\Gamma \ge \Gamma'$ and $\alpha \deq \vars{\Gamma'}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:affine-mode-1}, $\vars{\Gamma} \deq \alpha \otimes
\beta$ for some $\beta$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:affine-mode-5}, this means
$\Gamma \splits \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ with $\vars{\Gamma_1} \deq \alpha$.
Then the fact that $\Gamma \splits \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ implies $\Gamma
\ge \Gamma_1$ gives the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:strengthening-affine}
If $\seq{{\Gamma_0}^*}{\alpha}{A^*}$ and $\vec{x} \# \alpha$ then there
is a no larger derivation of $\seq{{\Gamma}^*-\vec{x}}{\alpha}{A^*}$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will use Lemma~\ref{lem:0-use-strengthening}.  First, no variables
are free in the range of weakening, so
Lemma~\ref{lem:spr-doesnt-introduce} gives that $\alpha \spr \beta$ and
$x \# \alpha$ imply $x \# \beta$.  Second, we prove by induction that
every subformula of $\Gamma^*$ and $A^*$ is relevant, because the only
context descriptors used are \F{x \otimes y}{x:A,y:B} and \U{c.c \otimes x}{x:A}{B}.
\end{proof}

We now prove that if $\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*}$ then
$\seqa{\Gamma}{A}$.  The proof is by induction on the size of the
assumption, because we will sometimes use
Lemma~\ref{lem:strengthening-affine} before appealing to the inductive
hypothesis.
\begin{itemize}
\item In the case for the assumption rule, we have
\[
\infer{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{P}}
      {x:P \in \Gamma^* &
       \vars{\Gamma} \spr x}
\]
Since $x:P \in \Gamma^*$, $x:P \in \Gamma$, and we can apply the affine
logic rule.  

\item In the case where \UR\/ was used to derive
  \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*}, $A$ must be $A_1 \lolli A_2$
  (because no other types encode to \Usymb), and the premise is
  \seq{\Gamma^*,x:A_1^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\otimes x}{A_2^*}.  The inductive
  hypothesis gives $\seqa{\Gamma,x:A_1}{A_2}$, and we can apply
  $\lolli$-right.

\item In the case where \FR\/ was used, the conclusion must be $(A_1
  \otimes A_2)$, and we have $\vars{\Gamma} \spr (\alpha_1 \otimes
  \alpha_2)$ with \seq{\Gamma^*}{\alpha_1}{A_1^*} and
  \seq{\Gamma^*}{\alpha_2}{A_1^*}.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:affine-mode-4},
  this means there is a $\Gamma \ge \Gamma'$ with $\vars{\Gamma'} \deq
  (\alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2)$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:affine-mode-5}, we
  have $\Gamma' \splits \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ with $\vars{\Gamma_1} \deq
  \alpha_1$ and $\vars{\Gamma_2} \deq \alpha_2$. So the premises are
  \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma_1}}{A_1^*} and
  \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma_2}}{A_2^*}.  By
  Lemma~\ref{lem:strengthening-affine}, we can modify the premises to
  no-bigger derivations of \seq{\Gamma_1^*}{\vars{\Gamma_1}}{A_1^*} and
  \seq{\Gamma_2^*}{\vars{\Gamma_2}}{A_2^*}.  Thus, by the inductive
  hypotheses we get $\seqa{\Gamma_1}{A_1}$ and $\seqa{\Gamma_2}{A_2}$,
  so $\seqa{\Gamma'}{A_1 \otimes A_2}$.  Then weakening and exchange on
  $\Gamma \ge \Gamma'$ gives the result.

\item 
  In the case where \FL\/ was used, the formula under elimination must
  be the translation of $z:(A_1 \otimes A_2) \in \Gamma$. The premise is
  \seq{\Gamma^*-z,x:A_1^*,y:A_2^*}{\vars{\Gamma}[(x \otimes y)/z]}{C^*},
  and we want \seqa{\Gamma}{C}.  Since \vars{\Gamma} has exactly one
  occurrence of $z$, $\vars{\Gamma}[(x \otimes y)/z] \deq
  (\vars{\Gamma}-z)\otimes x \otimes y$, so by the inductive hypothesis
  we get \seqa{\Gamma-z,x:A_1,y:A_2}{C} by the inductive hypothesis, and
  can apply $\otimes$-left.

\item In the case for \UL, the assumption $f$ that is eliminated must be
  the translation of $f:(A_1 \lolli A_2) \in \Gamma$ , so the premises
  are $\vars{\Gamma} \spr \beta'[f \otimes \alpha/z]$ with
  $\seq{\Gamma^*}{\alpha}{A_1^*}$ and
  $\seq{\Gamma^*,z:A_2^*}{\beta'}{C}$. 

  By Lemma~\ref{lem:affine-mode-4}, there is a $\Gamma'$ with $\Gamma
  \ge \Gamma'$ and $\vars{\Gamma'} \deq \beta'[f \otimes \alpha/z]$.
  Since $\vars{\Gamma'}$ has no duplicates, $z$ occurs at most once in
  $\beta'$ (or else $f$ would occur more than once in the substitution).
  
  If $z$ occurs once in $\beta'$, then because all context descriptors
  are products of variables, we can commute it to the end, writing
  $\beta' \deq \beta'' \otimes z$, so $\vars{\Gamma'} \deq \beta''
  \otimes f \otimes \alpha$.  Since $f$ is in \vars{\Gamma'}, $f$ must
  be declared with some type in $\Gamma'$, and since $\Gamma \ge
  \Gamma'$ and $f:A_1 \lolli A_2 \in \Gamma$, we must have $f:A_1 \lolli
  A_2 \in \Gamma'$.  So by Lemma~\ref{lem:affine-mode-5}, we can split
  $\Gamma' \splits \Delta_1;\Delta_2;f:A_1 \lolli A_2$ where
  $\vars{\Delta_2} \deq \beta''$ and $\vars{\Delta_1} \deq \alpha$.
  Using these equalities, the premises derive
  $\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A_1^*}$ and
  $\seq{\Gamma^*,z:A_2^*}{\vars{\Delta_2} \otimes z}{C}$, so by
  Lemma~\ref{lem:strengthening-affine} we can strengthen to no bigger
  derivations of
  $\seq{\Delta_1^*}{\vars{\Delta_1}}{A_1^*}$ (removing $\Gamma-\Delta_1$) and
  $\seq{\Delta_2*,z:A_2^*}{\vars{\Delta_2} \otimes z}{C}$ (removing $\Gamma-\Delta_2$).
  Then the inductive hypotheses give \seq{\Delta_1}{A_1} and
  \seq{\Delta_2,z:A_2}{C}, so we have the premises to use $\lolli$-left
  to conclude \seq{\Gamma'}{C}.  Finally, we weaken/exchange with
  $\Gamma \ge \Gamma'$.
  Since the splitting implies that $\Gamma' \ge \Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma'
  \ge \Gamma_2$, we have $\Gamma_0,z:A_2 \ge \Gamma_1,z:A_2$ and
  $\Gamma_0 \ge \Gamma_2$.  Moreover, we have $\beta' \deq \vec{y}
  \otimes z \deq \vars{\Gamma_1} \otimes z$ and $\alpha \deq
  \vars{\Gamma_2}$, so the premises are
  $\seq{\Gamma_0^*}{\vars{\Gamma_2}}{A_1^*}$ and
  $\seq{\Gamma_0^*,z:A_2^*}{\vars{\Gamma_1,z:A_2}}{C^*}$.  Thus, the
  inductive hypotheses give \seqa{\Gamma_2}{A_1} and
  \seqa{\Gamma_1,z:A_2}{C}, which combined with the splitting gives
  \seqa{\Gamma'}{C} by $\lolli$-left.  Finally, we have $\Gamma \ge
  \Gamma'$, so we can weaken/exchange to get \seqa{\Gamma}{C}.

  If $z$ occurs 0 times in $\beta'$ (that is, we did a \UL\/ that
  introduced a 0-use variable in the continuation), then we have
  premises \seq{\Gamma^*,z:A_2^*}{\beta'}{C} and $\vars{\Gamma} \spr
  \beta'$ (the substitution cancels).  By Lemma~\ref{lem:affine-mode-4},
  we get $\Gamma \ge \Gamma'$ with $\vars{\Gamma'} \deq \beta'$.  By
  Lemma~\ref{lem:strengthening-affine}, we can remove $z$ and anything
  in $\Gamma$ but not in $\Gamma'$ to get a no-bigger derivation of
  \seq{\Gamma'^*}{\vars{\Gamma'}}{C}.  Then the inductive hypothesis on
  this premise gives \seqa{\Gamma'}{C}, and weakening/exchanging with
  $\Gamma \ge \Gamma'$ gives the result.
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

\subsection{Cartesian Logic}

We compare the cartesian monoid mode theory from
Section~\ref{sec:ex:relevant-cartesian} with the following rules:
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\infer{\seqc{\Gamma}{P}}{x:P \in \Gamma}
\quad
\infer{\seqc{\Gamma}{A \times B}}
      {\seqc{\Gamma}{A} &
        \seqc{\Gamma}{B}}
\quad
\infer{\seqc{\Gamma}{C}}
      {p:A\times B \in \Gamma & 
        \seqc{\Gamma,x:A,y:B}{C}}
\\\\
\infer{\seqc{\Gamma}{A \to B}}
      {\seqc{\Gamma,x:A}{B}}
\quad
\infer{\seqc{\Gamma}{C}}
      {f: A \to B \in \Gamma &
        \seqc{\Gamma}{A} &
        \seqc{\Gamma,z:B}{C}
      }
\end{array}
\]
In this case, neither round-trip will be the identity on derivations,
though the one starting at these native rules will be the identity up to
a (positive/left) $\eta$ law for $\times$.  The difference is that the
above rules allow contraction for $A \times B$, whereas the framework
reduces this to contraction at $A$ and $B$ separately.  We could instead
compare against a native sequent calculus that does not allow
contraction for positives, but the above is more standard.  

The encoding of the rules is as follows:
\begin{lemma}
If $\seqc{\Gamma}{A}$ then \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*}.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on the given derivation, using the 
derivations of each rule:

\[
\infer[\dsd{v}]{\seq{\Gamma^*}{P^*}}
      {x:P^* \in \Gamma^* &
        1_{(\vars{\Gamma-x})\times x}[\dsd{w}/x] :: \vars{\Gamma-x} \times x \spr x}
\]

\[
\infer[\FR]{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{\F{x\times y}{x:A^*,y:B^*}}}
      {\dsd{c} :: \vars{\Gamma} \spr \vars{\Gamma} \times \vars{\Gamma} &
       \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*} & 
       \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{B^*}}
\]

\[
\infer[Lemma~\ref{lem:respectspr}]
      {\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{C^*}}
      { %% 1_{\vars{\Gamma-p}\times p}[\dsd{c}/p] :: 
        \vars{\Gamma} \spr \vars{\Gamma} \times p &
        \infer[Cor.~\ref{cor:contraction}]
              {\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\times p}{C^*}}
              {p : (A\times B)^* \in \Gamma^* &
                \infer[\FL]
                      {\seq{\Gamma^*,q:(A\times B)^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\times q}{C^*}}
                      {\seq{\Gamma^*,x:A^*,y:B^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\times x \times y}{C^*}}}
      }
\]

\[
\infer[\UR]
      {\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{\U{f.f\times x}{x:A^*}{B^*}}}
      {\seq{\Gamma^*,x:A^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\times x}{B^*}}
\]

\begin{small}
\[
\infer[\UL]
      {\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{C}}
      {f:(A\to B)^* \in \Gamma^* &
        \vars{\Gamma} \spr \vars{\Gamma} \times (f \times \vars{\Gamma}) &
        \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*} &
        \seq{\Gamma^*,z:B^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\times z}{B^*}
      }
\]
\end{small}

This shows that the above sequent calculus uses structural rules in the
following places: The hypothesis rule weakens away all other variables.
The $\times$ right rule contracts the entire context.  The $\times$ left
rule uses contraction for the mode theory ($p \spr p \times p$) and
contraction-over-contraction to duplicate $p$ to $q$---if we did not
have a contraction here in the native rule, then this would just be \FL,
as the $\to$ right rule is just \UR.  The $\to$ left rule contracts
everything in $\Gamma$ for use in both the argument and the
continuation, and contracts the function an additional time for use
here.
\end{proof}

Conversley, we have
\begin{lemma}
If \seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*} then $\seqc{\Gamma}{A}$ 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on the size of the given derivation, to allow
uses of
Lemma~\ref{lem:respectspr} before applying the inductive hypothesis.

\begin{itemize}

\item The hypothesis rule is immediate because $x:P^* \in \Gamma^*$
  implies $x:P \in \Gamma$.  

\item For a general use of \FR, the conclusion must be $(A \times B)^*$
  because this is the only type that encodes to an $\Fsymb$:
\[
\infer{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{\F{x\times y}{x:A,y:B}}}
      {\vars{\Gamma} \spr \alpha \times \beta &
        \seq{\Gamma^*}{\alpha}{A} &
        \seq{\Gamma^*}{\beta}{B}}
\]
Because we have projections, we can compose $\vars{\Gamma} \spr \alpha
\times \beta \spr \alpha$ and $\vars{\Gamma} \spr \alpha \times \beta
\spr \beta$, and apply these to the premises by
Lemma~\ref{lem:respectspr} to get no-bigger derivations of
$\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A}$ and $\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{B}$,
and then the inductive hypotheses and $\times$-right give the result.

This corresponds to treating this derivation as if it were 
\[
\infer{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{\F{x\times y}{x:A,y:B}}}
      {\vars{\Gamma} \spr \vars{\Gamma} \times \vars{\Gamma} &
        \infer{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A}}
              {\vars{\Gamma} \spr \alpha &
                \seq{\Gamma^*}{\alpha}{A}} &
        \infer{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{B}}
              {\vars{\Gamma} \spr \beta &
                \seq{\Gamma^*}{\beta}{B}}
      }
\]
where we contract all variables and weaken the premises with any that
did not already occur in $\alpha/\beta$.  In our equational theory on
derivations these two are indeed equal, assuming equations on
transformations giving the universal property of a cartesian product in
the mode theory.

\item For a general use of \FL, which must be on the encoding of a $p: A
  \times B \in \Gamma$, we have
\[
\infer{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{C}}
      {\seq{(\Gamma-p)^*,x:A^*,y:B^*}{\vars{\Gamma}[x \times y/p]}{C}}
\]
Because $\Gamma \deq (\Gamma-p)\times p$, the inductive hypothesis gives
a derivation of \seqc{\Gamma-p,x:A,y:B}{C}.  Using the admissible
weakening for cartesian logic, we have \seqc{\Gamma,x:A,y:B}{C}, so
$\times$-left gives the result.  That is, our given derivation does not
contract $p$, so we weaken with the extra occurence of $p$.

\item For \UR, the inductive hypothesis applied to the premise gives
  exactly the premise of $\to$-right.  

\item For \UL\/ on $f:(A\to B)^*$, we have
\[
\infer{\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{C^*}}
      {
        {\vars{\Gamma}} \spr \beta'[(f \times \alpha)/z] &
        \seq{\Gamma^*}{\alpha}{A^*} &
        \seq{\Gamma^*,z:B^*}{\beta'}{B^*}
      }
\]
Because all context descriptors are products of variables, we can
rewrite $\beta' \deq \beta'' \times z^k$ for some $k$ and $\beta''$ not
containing $z$.  Thus, we have 
$\vars{\Gamma} \spr \beta'' \times (f \times \alpha)^k$
so using
projections we have
$\vars{\Gamma} \spr \beta''$
and 
$\vars{\Gamma} \spr \alpha$.  
Using contraction, we have 
$\vars{\Gamma} \times z \spr \beta'' \times z^k$.
Applying these to the premises with Lemma~\ref{lem:respectspr}
gives derivations of 
\seq{\Gamma^*}{\vars{\Gamma}}{A^*} 
and 
\seq{\Gamma^*,z:B^*}{\vars{\Gamma}\times z}{B^*}.
Thus, the inductive hypotheses give the premises of $\to$-left.  

Equationally, the only thing suspicious about this is projecting
\emph{one} of the $\alpha$'s from $(f \times \alpha)^k$.   However,
\vars{\Gamma} has no duplicate variables, and for this mode theory any
map $x \spr x^k$ is the $k$-fold contraction of $x$.  Therefore, all
projections are the same, and contracting-projecting-recontracting is
the same as the original contraction.  

\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

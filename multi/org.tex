The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  In
Section~\ref{sec:syntax}, we present the rules of the logic.  In
Section~\ref{sec:exampleencodings}, we discuss how a number of logics
are represented.  In Section~\ref{sec:synprop-long}, we show how
identity and cut are implemented.  In Section~\ref{sec:equational}, we
give an equational theory on derivations.  In
Section~\ref{sec:adequacy-long}, we return to the examples, proving
logical adequacy of their representation.  In
Section~\ref{sec:semantics}, we discuss the logic's categorical
semantics.  In Section~\ref{sec:equational-permutative}, we give an
alternative presentation of equality of derivations, and in
Section~\ref{sec:adequacy-equational}, we discuss one example of
equational adequacy.
